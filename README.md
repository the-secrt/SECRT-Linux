# SECRT-Linux
This is a customized Linux distribution derived off Debian 12 (Bookworm) 

Please note that this is only a modified installation of Debian 12 packaged as a Live CD image with the Calamares installer (Utility used for installing Linux while booted into the Live CD) 

Currently, SECRT Linux uses the default Debian repositories for the package manager "apt". A future release of SECRT Linux may include it's own dedicated package repositories included. This is not a guarantee and there is no ETA for status on custom repositories.

The initial release of SECRT Linux is based on Alpine Linux and made for use inside the iOS app "iSH" A desktop release will be made available soon along with the intial Debian-based release.
