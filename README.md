# SECRT-Linux

SECRT Linux is a lightweight & fast Linux distribution - Currently with an Alpine-based build for the iSH emulator (Debian-based version coming soon for computers) 

Every SECRT Linux release tag will have two versions available prior to their release, a Debian-based image, and a Alpine-based image. 

Package management üì¶: 
The Alpine based SECRT Linux builds come with the "apk" package manager, known as the Alpine Package Keeper. 
Debian-based builds come with package managers "dpkg" and "apt"  APT is also known as Advanced Package Tool.
Currently, both Alpine and Debian-based builds use their original package management repositories, "deb.debian.org" for Debian, and "dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org" for Alpine.

Installation information ‚¨áÔ∏è: 
Currently, Debian-based SECRT Linux builds are Live CD images, and can be installed using the included installer, called Calamares. (see https://calamares.io/  for information about this installer utility) 
Alpine-based builds can be installed and setup using the command "setup-alpine" after logging in as the "root" user in the Live CD, default root password is "user"

This README file may be subject to change alongside with releases of new SECRT Linux builds.
